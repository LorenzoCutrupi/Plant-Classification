# Plant-Classification
Project for the course **"Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning"**. Given a dataset containing multiple plant images, train a **CNN** able to classify correctly all the images. We implemented various advanced techniques like *Augmentation*, *Outlier Detection*, *Transfer Learning*, *Fine Tuning*, and we were able to get 93% accuracy, reaching top 5 performances between all the groups (over 170) partecipating the challenge.

Professor: *Matteo Matteucci*
Final Score: 5.5/5 (award for particularly good projects)
